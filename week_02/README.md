# Week 2

## How Often Do I Pet my Pets?

### This visualization shows the amount of times I initiated play or quality time (e.g. affection, pets, etc.) with my dog and 2 cats. I spend a lot of time with them so I knew there would be quite a few data points. 

### I decided to document this data for each pet and further drill down on whether I was documenting during the day or the afternoon/evening time.
