1. Data source: Panel Study of Income Dyanmics, UMich, Michigan, (https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/default.aspx)

2. Description of data: Long running longitudinal survey that includes data from immigrant sample populations arriving in 1968 and low-income sample populations.

3. Why you are interested in this topic?: I'm interested in this topic because I'd like to use this for personal research this quarter. I'd like to analyze the economic mobility of low-income/immigrant households and their subsequent generations using the variables there.

4. Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data: Apart from running regressions on it for my own study, I think there may be interesting demographic indicators that I could visualize if there are enough data points. I know these samples are smaller than the nationally representative sample that UMich maintains. 

5. Potential data points: Income, education, country of origin, age when immigrated, family size.

6. Any concerns about the data: The size of it. I'm hoping the years I decide on will have a large enough sample of individuals.

7. Identify if source is primary or secondary: Primary

8. If secondary data, how you envision this data working with the primary source? NA
