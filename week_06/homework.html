        <h1>Police Killings by Race by Month</h1>
        <p>
            I chose a line chart because I wanted to understand if there was a trend over specific time frames for some of
            these acts of violence. I decided to plot it by race  over a years span where teh x-axis represents months.
            I would have liked to re-weight the data, since it's likely that white individuals may be over represented here.

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Police Killings by Mental Illness</h1>
        <p>
            Again, I wanted this visualization to be mental illness by race. I thought this was an interesting indicator.
            I hadn't previously interacted with a dataset linking mental illness to police violence. So it was interesting to see the levels 
            regardless of the stratification by race.

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Police Killings by Manner of Death and Race</h1>
        <p>
            I initally wanted to do these following charts as a grouped bar chart, but I could not get my code to work in time. 
            I wanted to see what the distribution looked like and if there was any pattern in how certain racial groups died. 
            If the visualization turned out how I wanted it to, I would have had manner of death grouped by race.
